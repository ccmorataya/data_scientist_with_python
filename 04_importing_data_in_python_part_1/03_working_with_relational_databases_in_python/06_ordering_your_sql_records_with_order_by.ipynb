    "<h1 class=\"exercise--title\">Filtering your database records using SQL's WHERE</h1>\n",
    "<p>You can now execute a basic SQL query to select records from any table in your database and you can also perform simple query customizations to select particular columns and numbers of rows.</p>\n",
    "<p>There are a couple more standard SQL query chops that will aid you in your journey to becoming an SQL ninja.</p>\n",
    "<p>Let's say, for example that you wanted to get all records from the <code>Customer</code> table of the Chinook database for which the <code>Country</code> is <code>'Canada'</code>. You can do this very easily in SQL using a <code>SELECT</code> statement followed by a <code>WHERE</code> clause as follows:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Country = 'Canada'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In fact, you can filter any <code>SELECT</code> statement by any condition using a <code>WHERE</code> clause. This is called <em>filtering</em> your records.</p>\n",
    "<p>In this interactive exercise, you'll select all records of the <code>Employee</code> table for which <code>'EmployeeId'</code> is greater than or equal to <code>6</code>.</p>\n",
