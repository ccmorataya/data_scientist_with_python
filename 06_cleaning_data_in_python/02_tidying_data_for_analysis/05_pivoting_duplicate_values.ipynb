    "<h1 class=\"exercise--title\">Pivoting duplicate values</h1>\n",
    "<p>So far, you've used the <code>.pivot_table()</code> method when there are multiple <code>index</code> values you want to hold constant during a pivot. In the video, Dan showed you how you can also use pivot tables to deal with duplicate values by providing an aggregation function through the <code>aggfunc</code> parameter. Here, you're going to combine both these uses of pivot tables.</p>\n",
    "<p>Let's say your data collection method accidentally duplicated your dataset. Such a dataset, in which each row is duplicated, has been pre-loaded as <code>airquality_dup</code>. In addition, the <code>airquality_melt</code> DataFrame from the previous exercise has been pre-loaded. Explore their shapes in the IPython Shell by accessing their <code>.shape</code> attributes to confirm the duplicate rows present in <code>airquality_dup</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>You'll see that by using <code>.pivot_table()</code> and the <code>aggfunc</code> parameter, you can not only reshape your data, but also remove duplicates. Finally, you can then flatten the columns of the pivoted DataFrame using <code>.reset_index()</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>NumPy and pandas have been imported as <code>np</code> and <code>pd</code> respectively.</p>"
