    "<p>Pandas relies on the <code>.hist()</code> method to not only generate histograms, but also plots of probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative density functions (CDFs).</p>\n",
    "<p>In this exercise, you will work with a dataset consisting of restaurant bills that includes the amount customers tipped. </p>\n",
    "<p>The original dataset is provided by the <a href=\"https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/tips.csv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seaborn package</a>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Your job is to plot a PDF and CDF for the <code>fraction</code> column of the tips dataset. This column contains information about what fraction of the total bill is comprised of the tip. </p>\n",
    "<p>Remember, when plotting the PDF, you need to specify <code>normed=True</code> in your call to <code>.hist()</code>, and when plotting the CDF, you need to specify <code>cumulative=True</code> in addition to <code>normed=True</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>All necessary modules have been imported and the tips dataset is available in the workspace as <code>df</code>. Also, some formatting code has been written so that the plots you generate will appear on separate rows.</p>"
