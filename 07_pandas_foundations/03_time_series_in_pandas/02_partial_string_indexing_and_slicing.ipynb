    "<h1 class=\"exercise--title\">Partial string indexing and slicing</h1>\n",
    "<p>Pandas time series support \"partial string\" indexing. What this means is that even when passed only a portion of the datetime, such as the date but not the time, pandas is remarkably good at doing what one would expect. Pandas datetime indexing also supports a wide variety of commonly used datetime string formats, even when mixed. </p>\n",
    "<p>In this exercise, a time series that contains hourly weather data has been pre-loaded for you. This data was read using the <code>parse_dates=True</code> option in <code>read_csv()</code> with <code>index_col=\"Dates\"</code> so that the Index is indeed a <code>DatetimeIndex</code>. </p>\n",
    "<p>All data from the <code>'Temperature'</code> column has been extracted into the variable <code>ts0</code>. Your job is to use a variety of natural date strings to extract one or more values from <code>ts0</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>After you are done, you will have three new variables - <code>ts1</code>, <code>ts2</code>, and <code>ts3</code>. You can slice these further to extract only the first and last entries of each. Try doing this after your submission for more practice.</p>"
