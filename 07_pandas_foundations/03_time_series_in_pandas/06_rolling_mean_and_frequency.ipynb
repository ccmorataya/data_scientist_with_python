    "<p>In this exercise, some hourly weather data is pre-loaded for you. You will continue to practice resampling, this time using rolling means.</p>\n",
    "<p>Rolling means (or moving averages) are generally used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in time series data and highlight long-term trends. You can read more about them <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n",
    "<p>To use the <code>.rolling()</code> method, you must always use method chaining, first calling <code>.rolling()</code> and then chaining an aggregation method after it. For example, with a Series <code>hourly_data</code>, <code>hourly_data.rolling(window=24).mean()</code> would compute new values for each hourly point, based on a 24-hour window stretching out <strong>behind</strong> each point. The frequency of the output data is the same: it is still hourly. Such an operation is useful for smoothing time series data. </p>\n",
    "<p>Your job is to resample the data using the combination of <code>.rolling()</code> and <code>.mean()</code>. You will work with the same DataFrame <code>df</code> from the previous exercise.</p>"
