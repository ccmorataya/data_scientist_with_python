    "<p>One common application of interpolation in data analysis is to fill in missing data. </p>\n",
    "<p>In this exercise, noisy measured data that has some dropped or otherwise missing values has been loaded. The goal is to compare two time series, and then look at summary statistics of the differences. The problem is that one of the data sets is missing data at some of the times. The pre-loaded data <code>ts1</code> has value for all times, yet the data set <code>ts2</code> does not: it is missing data for the weekends. </p>\n",
    "<p>Your job is to first interpolate to fill in the data for all days. Then, compute the differences between the two data sets, now that they both have full support for all times. Finally, generate the summary statistics that describe the distribution of differences.</p>"
