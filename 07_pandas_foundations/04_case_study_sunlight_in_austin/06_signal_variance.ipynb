You will then extract the temperature related columns from each - <code>'dry_bulb_faren'</code> in <code>df_clean</code>, and <code>'Temperature'</code> in <code>df_climate</code> - as NumPy arrays and compute the difference.</p>\n",
    "<p>Notice that the indexes of <code>df_clean</code> and <code>df_climate</code> are not aligned - <code>df_clean</code> has dates in 2011, while <code>df_climate</code> has dates in 2010. This is why you extract the temperature columns as NumPy arrays. An alternative approach is to use the pandas <code>.reset_index()</code> method to make sure the Series align properly. You will practice this approach as well.</p>"
