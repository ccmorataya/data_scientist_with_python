    "<p>In this exercise, your job is to plot the weekly average temperature and visibility as subplots. To do this, you need to first select the appropriate columns and then resample by week, aggregating the mean. </p>\n",
    "<p>In addition to creating the subplots, you will compute the Pearson correlation coefficient using <code>.corr()</code>. The Pearson correlation coefficient, known also as Pearson's r, ranges from -1 (indicating total negative linear correlation) to 1 (indicating total positive linear correlation). A value close to 1 here would indicate that there is a strong correlation between temperature and visibility.</p>\n",
